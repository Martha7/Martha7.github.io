## About Me

Hola, I'm Martha (_me llamo Martha_). I come from Mexico so I'm a native Spanish speaker, and I’ve lived in Wellington for many years.

I have over 25 years’ experience in teaching Spanish to adults and children, and I also work as a translator and interpreter. My accelerated learning methods have been very successful over the years.

I teach classes one to one or up to ten people, and run continuing education courses at university. I teach all levels Spanish 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. I also work with skype where required.

I teach language and culture of Latin America. I have taught several diplomats, ambassadors.

I love teaching Spanish and like it to be fun!
