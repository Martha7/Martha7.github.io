    <h2>About learning Spanish</h2>
    <p class="text-justify">New Zealanders already know - and use - a number of Spanish words. Here are a few:</p>

    <p><i>amigo, nachos, taco, tortilla, paella, pronto, simpatico, adios, cerveza, hasta la vista</i></p>

    <p class="text-justify">But would you like to speak Spanish? The way I teach Spanish is known as accelerated learning. With me, you get to talk in Spanish from day one.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">My emphasis is always on communicating. You’ll find you’re speaking, not writing. I’ll never ask you to learn long lists of words off by heart.</p>

    <p class="text-justify">My courses are designed for you to pick up the words and grammar you need as we discuss aspects of daily life (and Latin-American culture).<p>

    <p>I can help:</p>

    <blockquote>NCEA and university students pass exams with flying colours travellers make themselves understood when they go to Mexico and Latin-America or Spain families chat with their son’s fiancée from Argentina or their daughter’s husband from Spain business people deal with overseas markets.</blockquote>

    <p class="text-justify">The Spanish language is huge around the globe, spoken in 22 countries. If you’re keen on communicating in Spanish, get in touch with me!</p>
